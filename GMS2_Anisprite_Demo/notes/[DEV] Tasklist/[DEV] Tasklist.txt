[X] Remove instances of is_undefined and replace with == undefined
[X] Draw Test Sprite
[ ] Implement frame-progression methods
	- Moves anisprite frame forward by a set amount or until it hits a certain frame (check for "loop frame" to prevent infinite loop)
	- Activates any frame methods along the way
[X] Implement basic time-scaling features
	- step() methods can be called with an optional floating-point argument that acts as a multiplier on animation frame progression and motion effects
[-] Implement basic motion effects
	- Operate independently of animation process, updated via step() method
	- Changes the anisprite draw position using seperate offset values
	- Affected by timescaling (like everything else)
	- Create global table of motion effect functions that users can add to and utilize when building anisprite types with functions
[ ] Add/edit javadoc comments for all functions
